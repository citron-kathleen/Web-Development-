<br><h1><center> About the Mayon Volcano: </h1></center>
<center><p><font size=5> The name "Mayon," derived from the Bicolano word 
    "magayon," meaning beautiful, perfectly describes this natural wonder. 
    Beyond its beauty, the volcano holds centuries of history and folklore, 
    making it a symbol of resilience and culture in the region. Rising 2,462 
    meters above sea level, its majestic presence dominates the Albay province
     skyline, offering breathtaking views from nearly every corner of the region.
