<br><h1><center> About the Fort Santiago: </h1></center>
<center><p><font size=5> Fort Santiago is a historic citadel within Intramuros, 
    Manila, originally built by the Spanish in 1571 as a defensive fortress and 
    key trading point. It is best known as the last prison of the Philippine 
    national hero Jose Rizal before his execution in 1896, and now serves as a 
    museum and memorial site to his life and legacy. The fort also contains 
    dungeons where many lives were lost during the Spanish colonial period and 
    World War II, making it a significant site of Philippine history and culture.
