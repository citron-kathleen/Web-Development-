<br><h1><center> About the Batad Rice Terraces: </h1></center>
<center><p><font size=5> The Batad Rice Terraces are spectacular, ancient, 
    hand-carved terraces in Ifugao, Philippines, built by the indigenous Ifugao
     people over 2,000 years ago as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. They 
     resemble a grand amphitheater and are sustained by a unique, functional, 
     and ancient irrigation system that draws water from mountain springs and 
     forests. Accessing the site requires a hike through a lush forest to reach 
     the viewpoints, with the best views available during the planting (January)
      and harvest (March or April) seasons.
