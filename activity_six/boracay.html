<br><h1><center> About the Boracay: </h1></center>
<center><p><font size=5> Boracay is a small island in the central Philippines. 
    It's known for its resorts and beaches. Along the west coast, White Beach is 
    backed by palm trees, bars and restaurants. On the east coast, strong winds
    make Bulabog Beach a hub for water sports. Nearby, the observation deck on 
    Mount Luho offers panoramic views over the island. Offshore, coral reefs and 
    shipwrecks are home to diverse marine life.
