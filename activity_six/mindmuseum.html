<br><h1><center> About the Mind Museum: </h1></center>
<center><p><font size=5> The Mind Museum is the first world-class, large-scale 
    science museum in the Philippines, located in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.
     It features over 250 interactive exhibits and five interconnected 
     galleries—Atom, Life, Earth, Universe, and Technology—that explore the 
     wonders of science for all ages. The museum's mission is to engage people 
     in science, elevate community and national life, and inspire solutions to 
     real-world problems through its exhibits, planetarium shows, and 
     educational programs.
